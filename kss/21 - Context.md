<p>Map out your project with a big sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The goal is to organize your project into directories and repositories based on project goals, configurations, and contributors.</p>
<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>What are the goals for this project? How do those goals fit into your current software? How will this fit into future software?</p>
<h2 id="configurations">Configurations</h2>
<p>Strive to reuse code and all your work. This means that much of the code will be shared among multiple projects and configurations within the same project. List the configurations.</p>
<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>
<p>How many managers, designers, developers, artists, and other contributors do you plan to cycle through the project? Make it easy for new people to contribute. Organize your project to limit access to parts of the project in an appropriate way.</p>
