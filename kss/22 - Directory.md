<p>Organize your directory structure to mirror the breakdown of your project. Projects consist of multiple programs that share header files. Share only whatâ€™s necessary to minimize dependencies and maximize future flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="levels-of-sharing">Levels Of Sharing</h2>
<p>At the top level:</p>
<ul>
<li>world-wide
<ul>
<li>e.g. stdtypes.h, stdlib</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>external-libraries
<ul>
<li>SQLite, cURL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>company-wide</li>
<li>project-wide</li>
<li>platform-based</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shallow">Shallow</h2>
<p>Directory scope is from broad to narrow. Keep the directory depth down. Think about a directory as a package or library.</p>
